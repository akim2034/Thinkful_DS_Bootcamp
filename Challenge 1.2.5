What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?

-- Need to redo this section

Cheapest is probably during the holidays (December to January). There are not as many reviews so chances are people are staying home during the holidays. 

Busiest is probably months before August and September. Aug and Sept received the most amounts of reviews; this probably means people wrote reviews after their summer trips. 

Cheapest: 

SELECT 
	r.date,
	l.price
FROM 
	listings l
JOIN 
	reviews r
ON
	l.id = r.listing_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY price
