Find the bias (and maybe the initial design):

1) You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

Contextual bias: People are more likely to purchase bathing suits in May when summer is coming along than in February when winter has just ended in some parts of the world.

2) You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

Sampling bias: People who visit a clinic self-select to receive treatment for their potential clinical issues. By nature, you are going to see people with anxiety issues funneled there compared to the general population.

3) You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

Were there any other campaigns you launched? 

4) You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

Loyalty programs build rewards for customers in the long-term. The testing method is flawed here if the desired outcome is more customer visits in the first week.
