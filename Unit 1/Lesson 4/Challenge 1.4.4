Now it's time to flex your critical evaluation skills. Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.

1) The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

Emperor or Darth Vader should be chosen to deliver both slogans. The outcomes may have been from the orator's influence, not the slogan itself.


2) In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

It wasn't a random sample. Jar may have received more favorable reviews because of the friendly nature of the assigned planets. I would assign 2 friendly and 2 unfriendly planets to each envoy. 


3) A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

Classic case of Simpson's Paradox. The satisfaction scores would not only be broken down into HR and IT departments. It would have to be broken down into countries as well as departments in countries. By breaking it up into this level of granularity, you would be able to control for which variable truly affects the outcomes.


4) When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

I would measure for an extended amount of time to see when users drop off. True measure of effectiveness of the app is how engaged users are after an extended time after the installation. 


5) To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

She may have passed out Version B to a section of the classroom where all of the students who are smartest or hardest-working or best at cheating sit. The teacher needs to shuffle the test versions before passing it out to randomize the method.
