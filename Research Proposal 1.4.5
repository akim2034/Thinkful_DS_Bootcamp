Together vs. Anger Slogan

Problem: It is important to recruit droids because without them you wouldn't be able to fight. To recruit droids effectively, you need an effective slogan.

Potential solution:

Have the emperor deliver both the together and anger slogans to a group of 50 droids each, then measure how many droids want to join afterwards.

Method: 

Allow Emperor to deliver the slogans, measure outcomes. Continue with new sets of groups. You can extend to even more sets of groups or different orators. As long as the two groups are randomized and similar and the speaker is giving both the slogans.
