For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model. Discuss your reasoning with your mentor next time you meet.

1) The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.
Regression. Could be classification if you break time spent into spans (i.e. 1-2 hours, 3-4 hours, etc.).


2) What color car someone is going to buy.
Classification

3) How many children a family will have.
Classification

4) If someone will sign up for a service.
Classification

5) The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
Classification. Regression if we are looking for averages.

6) The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
Classification, with probabilities. 

7) Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
